<pre>
In this article, I will be going through the concept of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and how it has affected the way we live our
  lives in today's society. We can see how the IoE has made daily activities easier and more efficient. It has allowed us to find new ways to work,
  entertain, and think. This idea doesn’t consist only of electronic devices; it also involves people and data. It can also include the process 
  that the devices undergo to make better decisions. It has also affected things that our society doesn’t even realise, which is where it gets dangerous. 
  People get too dependent on this technology, which will make them lazier and start to lose the ability to function without it. 
  We can see both the benefits and the risks to us, and I will be going through both sides of this question.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3> 
<pre id="Intro_counter">
  The Internet of Everything is a concept in which the Internet connects everything in the world. It “ensures a lot of use in humans lives making it simpler, safer, 
 and more sensitive.”<a href="#ref-Agrawal">(Agrawal,2021)</a>  This idea doesn’t consist only of electronic devices; it also involves people and data. It can also include the process that the devices 
 undergo to make better decisions. The way these are all connected by the internet will be different. For example, people can connect through social media platforms
 like Instagram or Facebook. They can also be connected through devices like mobile phones. In today's society, we see that our world is dependent on technology, 
 and the way our lives function is reliant on these devices.

<h3 id="Analysis and Discussion">Analysis and Discussion</h3> 
  <pre id="Analysis_counter">
   <h4 id="Communication">Communication</h4>
  A major benefit of the Internet of Everything is how it has enhanced global communication. Internet access is expanding worldwide, with an estimated 
   5.5 billion people with internet access worldwide,which represents 68% of the global population.<a href="#ref-Statista">(Statista, 2025)</a> This enables people to communicate instantly across 
   long distances through the variety of services that include texting,calling and FaceTime. It can allow families and friends to have a closer relationship even from different countries. 
   Even with the creation of mobile networks like 4G/5G, which allows people to have a wireless cellular network. This makes communication easier,
   faster and more accessible since it can be used in the majority of urban areas.

   <h4 id="Daily life with IoE">Daily life with IoE</h4> 
One of the main things that the Internet of Everything has done is how it has simplified daily life. The rapid advancements in technology 
   continue to help people every day. In 2024, “the number of connected IoT devices reached 18.5 billion,” which is expected to grow by “14% in 2025.” 
   <a href="#ref-Sinha">(Sinha, 2025)</a> The 5th generation (5G) is the newest version of the mobile network, and it has been used in technologies “such as assisted driving [and] delivery robots.” 
   <a href="#ref-Telenor IoT">(Telenor IoT, 2025)</a> This hardware has been innovated by the idea of IoE and is aimed at creating a more efficient and user-friendly experience. 
   For example, the software integrated into cars allows the user to have a more efficient and reliable journey. This has been achieved as 5G provides
   “faster data transmission [which] enables real-time exchange of information [and] supports advanced driver assistance systems.”<a href="#ref-Technology Innovators">(Technology Innovators,2024)</a> 
   As a result, drivers get updates about disruptions with alternative routes immediately, which enables them to travel quickly with less stress.
   <h4 id="Job opportunities">Job opportunities</h4>
Another advantage of available internet access has allowed there to be so many more job opportunities. IoE has enabled us to access the internet on a range of devices,
   allowing users to interact with the World Wide Web (www). This is defined as “all public websites or pages that users can access on their local computers 
   and other devices through the internet”.<a href="#ref-Awati">(Awati, 2023)</a> This has changed the employment process as businesses can advertise digitally. 
   This will increase efficiency as it improves popularity while minimising environmental impact by using screens instead of physical material.  
   For job seekers, online platforms such as Indeed are the optimal method for finding jobs. Employers report that “the most common recruitment method was online job boards,
   rising from 67% to 79%.”<a href="#ref-Bernard">(Bernard,2025)</a> We carry these internet-enabled devices in our pockets, which makes accessing these opportunities quicker and more convenient. 
<img src="IOE recruitment - conference project.png" alt="Banner" width="600" height="400">
   <h4 id="Overreliency on technology">Overreliency on technology</h4>   
However, there are drawbacks to the Internet of Everything. Although the technology has simplified daily tasks, is it making our society lazier?
   As systems become increasingly advanced, we become over-reliant on them to complete our routine, which can lead to major consequences if a technical failure occurs.
   While technology is “increasing convenience,” it can lead to a “loss of control” as we forget how to complete activities that occur daily.<a href="#ref-Daruwala">(Daruwala,2025)</a> 
   For example, smart assistants like Alexa and Siri can manage reminders and alarms, eliminating the need for users to rely on their own memory. 
   Even common household devices, like the fridge, have been reshaped by IoE. Smart fridges have been implemented with screens that give you recipe guidance. 
   It can also assist with shopping as you can sync it to your phone, which will further diminish the need to remember. This can lead to a condition called “digital amnesia", 
   where people can’t “retain information as a result of storing information on a digital device.”<a href="#ref-Noreen">(Noreen,2015)</a> A study has asked 1000 people aged 16+ 
   about technology, and “91% of them depend on the internet and digital devices as a tool for remembering.”
    <h4 id="Privacy">Privacy</h4>  
A major risk that is commonly brought up with the Internet of Things is the privacy issues. IoE devices will collect valuable data such as “location, health details and home security.” 
    This data is stored on these devices, which will make it “more vulnerable to malicious attackers than PC and smartphones” as they have a “lack of proper security protection.”<a href="#ref-Dey">(Dey,2019)</a>
    The data collected can then be shared with third parties, which “involves transferring sensitive data across jurisdictions.”<a href="#ref-Emon">(Emon,2024)</a> When people sell this information, 
    they will gain very personal information about you, which is very dangerous. Many devices aren’t clear on what data is being collected or even how it is being used. 
    This makes it hard for the user to try and control what happens to it. Even home security can be infiltrated to gain personal information. Surveillance can be hacked into,
    which can be used to gain the user's profile, like their routine, location and habits. The data can also be sold for marketing or, even worse, for malicious uses. 
   <h4 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h4> 
In conclusion, the Internet of Everything has had a massive impact on our society in many ways. It offers significant benefits like global communication, 
   increased convenience and more job opportunities,but it also brings risks to society, such as being over-reliant on technology and privacy issues. 
   As a society, we can use IoE to bring even more advantages as long as we know the risks and make sure to use the devices correctly and safely.
